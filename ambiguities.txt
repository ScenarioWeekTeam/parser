Ambiguities

Paragraph: ยง7
Problem: The format for negative rationals between -1 and 0 is ambiguous. It is not clear if a negative quarter is acceptable as a negative fraction'-1/4' or is it necessary to display it as a mixed fraction with 0 as the whole number '-0_1/4'.
Our Solution: We decided to accept negative rationals between -1 and 0 as a negative fraction without the need for displaying as a mixed fraction. This mean we accept negative rationals such as -1/4.

Paragraph: ยง7
Problem: Its not clear if for negative rationals less than -1, a minus sign can precede both the whole number and fraction. E.g. "-345_-6/5".
Our Solution: In normal mathematics, this is not accepted so our compiler rejects this syntax.

Paragraph: ยง11
Problem: It is not clear if both indices can be omitted for a sequence slice [:].
Our Solution: As it is supported in other languages, our compiler will accept this syntax.
