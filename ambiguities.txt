Ambiguities

Paragraph: §7
Problem: The format for negative mixed rationals is ambiguous. It is not clear from the given examples if a negative quarter is acceptable as a negative fraction '-1/4' or is it necessary to display it as a mixed fraction with 0 as the whole number '-0_1/4'.
Our Solution: We decided to accept these negative non-mixed fractions such as '-1/4'.

Paragraph: §7
Problem: It is not clear if a minus sign can precede the fraction. E.g. '-345_-6/5'.
Our Solution: In standard mathematical notation, the fraction and numbers' sign cannot be seperate without being regarded as seperate numbers placed together via addition - so our compiler rejects this syntax.

Paragraph: §10, 11
Problem: Considering paragraph §9, which specifically states that zero length lists are allowed - how does this interact with the limitation on indexes to be within the the range of its length (positive to negative)?
Our Solution: N/A - Considering CUP parsing alone cannot detect this failure of array indexing being out of bounds, this ambiguity is beyond our scope to resolve.

Paragraph: §11
Problem: It is not clear if both indices can be omitted for a sequence slice '[:]'.
Our Solution: As it is supported in other languages, our compiler will accept this syntax.

Paragraph: §13
Problem: It is ambiuous whether an empty declaration_list when using 'tdef' is allowed.
Our Solution: Considering that a type definition with no fields has no functional purpose, our compiler rejects an empty declaration_list.
